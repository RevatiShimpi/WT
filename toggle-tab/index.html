        <h3>EDI Relevance</h3>
        <p>Project Centric Learning (PCL) is a powerful tool for students to work in areas 
            of their choice and strengths. Along with course based projects, curriculum can be enriched with 
            semester long Engineering Design and Development courses, in which students can solve socially 
            relevant problems using various technologies from relevant disciplines. The various socially relevant 
            domains can be like Health care, Agriculture, Defense, Education, Smart City, Smart Energy and 
            Swaccha Bharat Abhiyan. To gain the necessary skills to tackle such projects, students can select 
            relevant online courses and acquire skills from numerous sources under guidance of faculty and 
            enrich their knowledge in the project domain, thereby achieving project centric learning. Modern 
            world sustained and advanced through the successful completion of projects. In short, if students are 
            prepared for success in life, we need to prepare them for a project-based world. It is a style of active 
            learning and inquiry-based learning. Project centric learning will also redefine the role of teacher as 
            mentor in the learning process. The PCL model focuses the student on a big open-ended question, 
            challenge, or problem to research and respond to and/or solve. It brings students not only to know, 
            understand and remember rather it takes them to analyze, design and apply categories of Bloom‘s 
            Taxonomy. </p>
            <p>Students must focus to initiate the task/idea .The idea inception and consideration shall be 
                from following areas as a real world problem: 
                Health Care, Agriculture, Defense, Education, Smart City, Smart Energy, Swaccha Bharat 
                Abhiyan, Environment, Women Safety.  
                This is the sample list to start with. Faculty and students are free to include other areas which 
                meet the society requirements at large. 
                The model begins with the identifying of a problem, often growing out of a question or ―wondering‖. This formulated problem then stands as the starting point for learning. Students 
                design and analyze the problem/project within an articulated disciplinary subject 
                frame/domain. 
                A problem can be theoretical, practical, social, technical, symbolic, cultural, and/or scientific 
                and grows out of students‘ wondering within different disciplines and professional 
                environments. A chosen problem has to be exemplary. The problem may involve an 
                interdisciplinary approach in both the analysis and solving phases. 
                By exemplarity, a problem needs to refer back to a particular practical, scientific, social and/or 
                technical domain. The problem should stand as one specific example or manifestation of more 
                general learning outcomes related to knowledge and/or modes of inquiry. </p>

        <h3>Role of Teachers and Students</h3>
        <p><b>Teacher’s Role in PCL : </b>
            Teacher is not the source of solutions rather he will they act as the facilitator and mentor. 
            To utilize the principles of problems solving, critical thinking and metacognitive skills of the 
            students. 
            To aware the group about time management. 
            Commitment to devote the time to solve student‘s technical problems and interested in 
            helping students to empower them better.</p>
        <p><b>Student’s Role in PCL :</b>
            Students must quickly learn how to manage their own learning, Instead of passively receiving 
            instruction. 
            Students in PCL are actively constructing their knowledge and understanding of the situation 
            in groups. 
            Students in PCL are expected to work in groups. 
            They have to develop interpersonal and group process skills, such as effective listening or 
            coping creatively with conflicts. </p>

        <h3>Literature Survey and Paper Publication</h3>
        <p>It is integral part of  self- directed learning 
            Identify the information needed to solve a given problem or issue 
            Be able to locate the needed information 
            Use the information to solve the given problem effectively. 
            Skills required by students in information literacy include:    
            How to prepare the search?   How to carry out the research 
            Interpersonal Skills 
            Resources Evaluation 
            Sorting and assessing of information in general 
            <p>Use of Research Methodology: - investigation, collaboration, comprehension, application, analysis, 
            synthesize and evaluation </p>
            <p>Focus on following skills while working in a team to reach to solution:   
            Collaborative learning 
            Metacognitive Skills 
            Reflection Skills </p>
